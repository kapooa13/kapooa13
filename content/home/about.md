My name is Ankit Kapoor and I'm a Computer Science student at [@McMaster University](https://mcmaster.ca).

I'm an incoming SDE intern at [@Amazon](https://amazon.com) for Summer 2021.
In the past, I've worked as a Software Developer at [@Arctic Wolf](https://arcticwolf.com)
and held multiple teaching and research postions at [@McMaster University](https://mcmaster.ca).

I'm a hard and meticulous worker who's always looking for new ways to challenge myself. Outside of
university, I'm enjoy playing the guitar and trying to make sense of the stock market.
